"The term Internet of Things was proposed by Kevin Ashton in 1999,... it originally refers to uniquely identifiable objects and their virtual representations in an Internet-like structure. Today however, the term Internet of Things is used to denote advanced connectivity of devices, systems and services that goes beyond the traditional machine-to-machine (M2M) and covers a variety of protocols, domains and applications."
